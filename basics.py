# THE BACKSLASH (\) -> is called the escape character.

# The backslash doesn't mean anything in itself, but is only a kind of announcement, that the next character after the backslash has a different meaning too.

#In this example, after we put the backslash (\), the second part of the sentence sentence will appears on the next line:

#print("Black keys white keys, \nbettet friends understand.")
      # Output: 
          #   Black keys white keys, 
          #   bettet friends understand.

# KEYWORD ARGUMENTS -> Are another mechanism for the passing of arguments.

# /// end= ---> The end keyword argument determines the characters the print() function sends to the output once it reaches the end of its positional arguments. 

# print('Hello, mate', end=', ')
# print('How are you?')
      #Output: Hello, mate, How are you?

# /// sep= ---> The sep keyword function separates its outputted arguments with a characther given. 

print('eva','00','Rei',sep='_')
      #Output: eva_00_Rei
